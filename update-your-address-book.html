<h1>Update Your Address Book</h1>
	       
<p>In an effort to be more efficient as a family and as an homage to the patriarch of the Lewis clan, we have opted to project a more unified facade.</p>

<h2>Enter <em>Lewis Aviation</em></h2>

<p>The past was a smattering of dark times rubbed across a canvas consisting of fibers with distinctly shoddy branding: @hotmail.com; @comcast.net; @united.net. It was a time when men were men and children were men, sharing the same adult subscriptions under the umbrella of a "unified inbox." Those times are no more.</p>

<p>Now, whenever you want to contact a member of the Lewis family, all you need to do is think of the name and affix <code>@lewisaviation.com</code> to the end of it (as you would a Forever stamp to a parcel). Do you have a hillarious video of a monkey falling down that you know Cynthia would get a kick out of? Try <code>cynthia@lewisaviation.com</code>. If you're feeling a tad less formal (the video involves him picking his nose &mdash; how gauche!), send it to <code>cindy@lewisaviation.com</code>. She'll still get it, in all its glory.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Don't try it, cool guy.</strong> I know you're smarter than us. There's no need to prove it by sending it to <code>cici@lewisaviation.com</code>, <code>ceelo@lewisaviation.com</code>, <code>see-to-the-indy@lewisaviation.com</code> or something equally ludicrious and complaining that the email bounced. These shortcuts are for your convienience. Just use what is listed below, smile and say, "Thank you."</blockquote>

<h2>The Skinny; or, The Part You Care About</h2>

<p>Without further ado, here's the complete list of email addresses for the Lewis family. Feel free to use any of these and rest assured they will reach the indented target.</p>

<h2>There You Have It</h2>

<p>I hope this will help you keep in touch with us in the future! We can't wait to hear from you &mdash; getting email at a new address is like getting your first letter in a new house; however, there's no need for you to "test the email." We didn't pay to send Zachary to nerd-school so he could learn how to not set up some email.</p>
